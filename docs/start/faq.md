### AM Browser FAQ

- How does the access control work?

    For the access control of UI functionalities, two groups of users are supported:
    - Admin, those who have the administrator role set in AM (can be found in `Employee and departments`->`Profile` tab -> `Administration rights` ) can access all UI functionalities.
    - Non-admin, can only access `Search`, `Insight` and `Viewer`.
    The data access control permission has the same configuration as `User Rights`, which is based on the operations against each table. (Log on to the AM client as an administrator, menu `Administration`-> `Rights` -> `User rights`)
