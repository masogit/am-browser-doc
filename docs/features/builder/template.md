# AM Browser Template Builder
A template is a collection of certain styles defined to format reports. AM Browser allows you to build, manage, share and apply template to your report.  

Next to the header menu, there are two major panels in the template builder, which are:

- Style defining panel
- Preview panel

## Header menu
The header menu includes a few functionalities:

  - Export -- In the pop-up window, AM Browser enables you to decide the amount and beginning point for exporting records.
  - Save -- Save the template.
  - Delete  -- Remove a defined template.
  - Misc menu -- The drop-down menu has two items:

      - Preview -- Manually trigger a preview action in the preview panel.
      - Duplicate -- Duplicate a template from an existing one.

## Style defining panel
AM Browser enables you to apply styles to your report's different sections:

  - Page header
  - Report body
  - Page footer
  - Page orientation

### Logo upload
You can upload the logo of your organization and attach it to generated reports.  
To upload a logo, click on the ![Logo png](../img/logo_button.png) button, select the logo picture of your organization through the file manager of the operating system.  
After the uploading process completes, a preview of the logo will appear on the right.

### Style Designer  
AM Browser extracts a few components of report and makes built-in styles for them.

Click on the ![Style Designer](../img/style_designer.png) button to access them.
On the pop up Style Designer page, you will see all built-in styles including Header, sub header, text, table Title, field Title, and so on.

AM Browser allows you to refine the built-in styles as needed.
For example, you can increase its font size, change its text color, or make the text bold or italics.
AM Browser enables you to do all of them on the Style designer layer page. As well, there is a preview panel to reflect your changes.

In addition, you can also keep the built-in styles and create a new style.

## Preview panel
AM Browser can detect your changes to the styles. It refreshes the preview panel automatically to sync your style modifications.  
For performance considerations, AM Browser limits the number of previewed records to 10.  
During the creation of a template, AM Browser provides hypothetical demo records for you to review your styles changes.
